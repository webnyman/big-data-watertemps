# Assignment WT2 - Web for Data Science

As data scientists working with large amounts of data we are constantly seeking ways to gain insights, visualize, and present our results appropriately. We want to not only understand the data but allow our stakeholders to explore and gain their own insights. This involves efficient data handling on the backend, powerful data manipulation and analysis, and visually engaging, interactive data presentations on the front-end. 
The overall goal is not to create an ordinary static chart/graph but interactive visualization that tells a story and
make it available on the web.

## The assignment

**Objective**: Create a functional, visually engaging data visualization based on a large dataset and make it available on the web. The final output should provide meaningful insights to the end-user about the dataset in consideration. Visualisation should be interactive and include controls 
to filter data and in other ways interact with the graph. Your application should be deployed and publically accessible.


**Technologies**: Youâ€™re free to use any technologies or platforms you feel comfortable with or wish to explore, but some suggestions include

**Backend**: Node.js / Express.js / FastAPI / Flask / C# / Java

**Data Analysis & Processing**: Python/Pandas / ElasticSearch / Google BigQuery

**Data Visualization**: D3.js / Chart.js / Plotly / Kibana / Grafana 

**Front-end application**: HTML / CSS / JavaScript / Bootstrap / React.js / Vue.js 

## Assignment Details:

**STEP 1**: Find a large _dataset_ that interests you. Your dataset should have a minimum of 1000 data points. Data can be found on resources like Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), but feel free to find your own or use an API to pull the data. 

**STEP 2**: Design and build a backend to load and process your dataset. 

**STEP 3**: Create an insightful and interactive visualization with a library or tool of your choice. Your visualization should offer value and insights about your dataset.

**STEP 4**: Develop a frontend using a technology of your choice to display your dataset and visualization.

**STEP 5**: Deploy your web application so it's publically accessible

Remember that the primary goal of this assignment is to create a meaningful, visually engaging interactive data visualization that offers genuine insight into your chosen dataset and incorporate it into your web app.
